# Beneficial Strategies ISO20022 Library

This project contains a .NET implementation of containers for 2,665 different types of financial services messages as defined by the [ISO20022](https://iso20022.org) standard.

## Thank you

You are about to download an implementation of the entire domain model for the [ISO20022](https://iso20022.org) standard.
By design, serialization is **not included** in this library. Given the complexity and vastness of this library, that is alone is the appropriate scope.

The purpose of this library, by itself, is to simply present a faithful rendering of the data in memory in a .NET application.
There are follow-on projects that do the serialization, validation, etc.  However, this is the bedrock that must be laid first.

Great attention has been put on certain details:
- It is packaged in a way that your *intellisense* or compatible tech in your build tool should have access to source code.
- You should see commenting on all types giving your analysis information on how each class or setting should be used.
- We go back three versions in .NET core.  
- New features like "required" properties are utilized so the compiler helps you construct valid Iso20022 messages.
- Great effort was made to support records and value-equivilency throughout.
- Where the multiplicity of a property was unapparent, we defaulted to a collection.

Known limitations:
- Digital signatures not yet supported.
- External content not yet supported.
- External schema not yet supported.

## Trying out the library 

To try using the messages, start by putting this using statement in the top of your program.

```C#
using Beneficial = BeneficialStrategies.Iso20022;
using BeneficialStrategies.Iso20022.Codesets;
```

Within your application, you should then be able to instance this message as well as others.  This particular example was taken from [a document](https://www.iso20022.org/business-area-message-set/81/1135/download) on the [Iso20022 web site](https://iso20022.org).
