    [Description(@"Specified purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) are public companies comprised of cash available to investors in financial markets. The sole purpose of SPACs is to use the proceeds to finance a future acquisition. SPACs generally commit to identify a target operating company and complete a business combination transaction within a specified timeframe. SPACS have a feature where funds are put into a trust account and when the target investment is identified the investor can have their proceeds returned or participate in the business combination.")]
