/// Defines a business letter containing identifications of involved entities and their roles, references to documents, free form text and signatures.
/// The semantics of this information are defined by usual business practices for the exchange and tracing of business letters. The described references and party identifiers permit to establish a linked informal trace of sequences of letters.
/// This message component contains three types of elements that can be referenced using IDREF:
/// (1) - all elements defining qualified parties,
/// (2) - all elements defining qualified documents or references to them,
/// (3) - the LegalContext element.
