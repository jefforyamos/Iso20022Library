Can be used in combination with DTCC sub event type (when provided) to identify the event. For an example: a distribution based on recapitalisation event will be presented as event type: OTHR in standard message. DTCC native event type would be Distribution (DIST) and DTCC sub event type would be Recapitalisation.
