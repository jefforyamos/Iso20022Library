/// <summary>
/// Defines an encapsulated form of an ISO 20022 message and, if present, its associated Business Application Header. The encapsulation guarantees uniqueness of ID/IDREFs though the use of the Prefix element. This element can be added during message preparation to ID/IDREFs. In order to verify the signature in the Hdr element or inside the encapsulated message, for each occurrence of an ID orIDREF that possesses the same value as a prefix, the prefix part is removed before signature verification. This is not done for surrounding signatures.
