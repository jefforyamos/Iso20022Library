/// Cash management feature limiting the maximum risk a party accepts to take with respect to a counterparty or a set of counterparties. A risk management limit is either bilateral, ie, for a counterparty, or multilateral, ie, for a set of counterparties or all other members in a system.The limit may also apply to sponsored members, ie, indirect members. In principle, a risk management limit is calculated on the net position between two members and is expressed as a credit or debit limit, from the point of view of the party setting the limit.
