/// Defines an identifier for a party relative to another party using an identifier of another party followed by a local identifier issued by the other party.
/// It is assumed that customers of an identifiable party can be referenced by an identifier relative to that party. The identification of the party together with the relative identifier identifies the customer.
/// Such references can occur in sequence. The last occurrence of RelativeIdentifier is the local identifier at the party recursively defined by the PrefixParty and all preceding occurrences of RelativeIdentifier.
/// Technical note: The sequence of relative identifiers is used to avoid a recursive definition in the catalogue.
