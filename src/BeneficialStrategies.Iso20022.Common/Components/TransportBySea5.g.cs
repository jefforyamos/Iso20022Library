    /// International Maritime Organisation identification of a ship. The IMO identification number scheme was introduced in 1987 as a measure aimed at enhancing maritime safety and pollution prevention and to facilitate the prevention of maritime fraud. It assigns a permanent number to each vessel for identification purposes. This number remains unchanged upon transfer of the vessel to other flag(s) and is inserted in all vessel certificates. The IMO identification number is made up of the three letters "IMO" followed by a seven-digit number assigned to all vessels by IHS FairPlay (formerly known as Lloyd's Register-Fairplay). This is a unique seven digit number that is assigned to vessels and aids banks in determining whether a vessel is subject to an order that would not permit a bank to handle a certain transaction under local or international laws.
