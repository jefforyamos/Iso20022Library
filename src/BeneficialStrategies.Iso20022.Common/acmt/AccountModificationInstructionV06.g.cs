/// Scope

/// - to maintain/update any of the existing account details, for example, to update the address of the beneficiary or modify the preference to income from distribution to capitalisation, or,
/// - to add/create specific details to the existing account when these details were not yet recorded at the time of account creation, for example, to add a second address or to establish new cash settlement standing instructions, or,
/// - to delete specific account details, for example, delete cash standing instructions.
/// This message cannot be used to delete an entire account, as institution specific and regulatory rules pertaining to account deletion are diverse.
/// The usage of this message may be subject to service level agreement (SLA) between the counterparties.
