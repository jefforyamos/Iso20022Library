/// Scope
/// An account owner, for example, an investor or its designated agent sends the AccountOpeningInstruction message to the account servicer, for example, a registrar, transfer agent or custodian to instruct the opening of an account or the opening of an account and establishing an investment plan.
/// Usage
/// The AccountOpeningInstruction is used to open an account directly or indirectly with the account servicer or an intermediary.
/// In some markets, for example, Australia, and for some products in the United Kingdom, a first order (also known as a deposit instruction) is placed at the same time as the account opening.
