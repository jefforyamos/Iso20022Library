/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the camt.052.001.01 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// The Bank-to-Customer Account Report message is sent by the account servicer to an account owner or to a party authorised by the account owner to receive the message. It can be used to inform the account owner, or authorised party, of the entries reported to the account, and/or to provide the owner with balance information on the account at a given point in time.
/// Usage
/// The Bank-to-Customer Account Report message can contain reports for more than 1 account. It provides information for cash management and/or reconciliation. It can be used to:
/// - report pending and booked items;
/// - provide balance information
/// It can include underlying details of transactions that have been included in the entry.
/// It is possible that the receiver of the message is not the account owner, but a party entitled by the account owner to receive the account information (also known as recipient).
/// For a statement that is required due to local legal stipulations, the Bank-to-Customer Account Statement message should be used.
