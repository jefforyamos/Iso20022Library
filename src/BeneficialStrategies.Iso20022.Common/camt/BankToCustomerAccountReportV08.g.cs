/// This record is an implementation of the camt.052.001.08 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// The BankToCustomerAccountReport message is sent by the account servicer to an account owner or to a party authorised by the account owner to receive the message. It can be used to inform the account owner, or authorised party, of the entries reported to the account, and/or to provide the owner with balance information on the account at a given point in time.
