/// <summary>
/// Scope
/// The CancelCaseAssignment message is sent by a case creator or case assigner to a case assignee. This message is used to request the cancellation of a case.
/// Usage
/// The CancelCaseAssignment message is used to stop the processing of a case at a case assignee when a case assignment is incorrect or when the root cause for the case disappears (such as the account owner was able to reconcile after sending a ClaimNonReceipt message).
/// The CancelCaseAssignment message can be used to stop the processing of a:
/// - request to cancel payment case;
/// - request to modify payment case;
/// - unable to apply case;
/// - claim non receipt case.
/// The CancelCaseAssignment message covers one and only one case at a time. If several case assignments need to be cancelled, then multiple CancelCaseAssignment messages must be sent.
/// The CancelCaseAssignment message must be forwarded by all subsequent case assignee(s) in the case processing chain until it reaches the end point.
/// When an agent re-assigns the CancelCaseAssignment to a subsequent case assignee, this agent must send a NotificationOfCaseAssignment message to its assigner.
/// When the CancelCaseAssignment instruction has been acted upon by the relevant case assignee, a ResolutionOfInvestigation message is sent to the case assigner or case creator, in reply.
/// The CancelCaseAssignment message must not be used for other purposes. If, for example, a request to modify payment fails, and the case creator requests the cancellation of the payment, then a CustomerPaymentCancellationRequest or FIToFIPaymentCancellationRequest message must be used, with the case identification of the original RequestToModifyPayment message. In this context it is incorrect to use the CancelCaseAssignment message.
