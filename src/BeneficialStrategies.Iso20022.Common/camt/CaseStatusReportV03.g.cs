/// <summary>
/// Scope
/// The Case Status Report message is sent by a case assignee to a case creator or case assigner.
/// This message is used to report on the status of a case.
/// Usage
/// A Case Status Report message is sent in reply to a Case Status Report Request message. This message
/// - covers one and only one case at a time. (If a case assignee needs to report on several cases, then multiple Case Status Report messages must be sent.)
/// - may be forwarded to subsequent case assigner(s) until it reaches the end point
/// - is able to indicate the fact that a case has been assigned to a party downstream in the payment processing chain
/// - may not be used in place of a Resolution Of Investigation (except for the condition given in the next bullet point) or Notification Of Case Assignment message
/// - may be skipped and replaced by a Resolution Of Investigation message when the request for a investigation status is received at the time the assigner has resolved the case. (In this case a Resolution Of Investigation message can be sent instead of a Case Status Report and the case may be closed.).
