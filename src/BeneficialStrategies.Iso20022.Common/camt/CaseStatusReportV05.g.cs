/// Scope
/// The CaseStatusReport message is sent by a case assignee to a case creator or case assigner.
/// This message is used to report on the status of a case.
/// Usage
/// A CaseStatusReport message is sent in reply to a CaseStatusReportRequest message. This message
/// - covers one and only one case at a time. (If a case assignee needs to report on several cases, then multiple CaseStatusReport messages must be sent);
/// - may be forwarded to subsequent case assigner(s) until it reaches the end point;
/// - is able to indicate the fact that a case has been assigned to a party downstream in the payment processing chain;
/// - may not be used in place of a ResolutionOfInvestigation (except for the condition given in the next bullet point) or NotificationOfCaseAssignment message;
/// - may be skipped and replaced by a ResolutionOfInvestigation message when the request for a investigation status is received at the time the assigner has resolved the case. (In this case a ResolutionOfInvestigation message can be sent instead of a CaseStatusReport and the case may be closed).
