/// This record is an implementation of the camt.027.001.01 ISO standard message type.

/// Scope|The Claim Non Receipt message is sent by a case creator/case assigner to a case assignee.|This message allows to initiate an investigation in case the beneficiary of a payment has not received an expected payment.|Usage|Note 1: Although there are cases where a creditor would contact the creditor's bank when claiming non-receipt, the activity only retained the scenario where the beneficiary claims non-receipt with its debtor, the debtor in its turn contacting the first agent. Therefore the investigation follows the same route as the original instruction.|Note 2: This message is also used to report a missing cover. The rationale behind this is that the beneficiary of the cover (receiver of the payment instruction) missing the cover would be in the very same position as a beneficiary expecting a credit to its account and would therefore trigger the same processes.|In case of a Missing cover, the case will be assigned to the sender of the payment instruction, before following the route of the payment instruction.
