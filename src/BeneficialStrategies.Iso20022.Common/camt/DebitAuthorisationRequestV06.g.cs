/// Scope
/// The Debit Authorisation Request message is sent by an account servicing institution to an account owner. This message is used to request authorisation to debit an account.
/// Usage
/// The Debit Authorisation Request message must be answered with a Debit Authorisation Response message.
/// The Debit Authorisation Request message can be used to request debit authorisation in a:
/// - request to modify payment case (in the case of a lower final amount or change of creditor)
/// - request to cancel payment case (full amount)
/// - unable to apply case (the creditor whose account has been credited is not the intended beneficiary)
/// - claim non receipt case (the creditor whose account has been credited is not the intended beneficiary)
/// The Debit Authorisation Request message covers one and only one payment instruction at a time. If an account servicing institution needs to request debit authorisation for several instructions, then multiple Debit Authorisation Request messages must be sent.
/// The Debit Authorisation Request must be used exclusively between the account servicing institution and the account owner. It must not be used in place of a Request To Modify Payment or Request To Cancel Payment message between subsequent agents.
