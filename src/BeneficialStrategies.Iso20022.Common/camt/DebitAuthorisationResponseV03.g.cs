/// Scope
/// The Debit Authorisation Response message is sent by an account owner to its account servicing institution. This message is used to approve or reject a debit authorisation request.
/// Usage
/// The Debit Authorisation Response message is used to reply to a Debit Authorisation Request message.
/// The Debit Authorisation Response message covers one and only one payment instruction at a time. If an account owner needs to reply to several Debit Authorisation Request messages, then multiple Debit Authorisation Response messages must be sent.
/// The Debit Authorisation Response message indicates whether the account owner agrees with the request by means of a code. It also allows further details to be given about the debit authorisation, such as acceptable amount and value date for the debit.
/// The Debit Authorisation Response message must be used exclusively between the account owner and the account servicing institution. It must not be used in place of a Resolution Of Investigation message between subsequent agents.
