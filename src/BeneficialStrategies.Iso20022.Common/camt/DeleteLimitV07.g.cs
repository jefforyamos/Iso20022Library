/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the camt.012.001.07 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// The DeleteLimit message is sent by a member to the transaction administrator.
/// It is used to request the deletion of one particular, several or all limits set by the member and managed by the transaction administrator.
/// The DeleteLimit message may delete several types of current limits (risk or liquidity management limit), based on a multiple requests.
/// Usage
/// The member will submit a DeleteLimit message identifying which limit(s) it wants to delete (current limit risk/liquidity limit concepts have been merged) based on following criteria:
/// - type of limit(s) (current/default)
/// - value of the limit(s) (default and/or current limit(s))
/// - identification of the counterparty (bilateral limit)
/// Based on the criteria received within the DeleteLimit message, the transaction administrator will execute or reject the requested modifications.
/// The transaction administrator may send a Receipt message as a reply to the DeleteLimit request.
/// To verify the outcome of the request, the member may submit a GetLimit message with the appropriate search criteria.
/// </summary>
