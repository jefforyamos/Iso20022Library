/// <summary>
/// Scope
/// A report provider, such as a transfer agent, sends the FundEstimatedCashForecastReport message to the report user, such as an investment manager or pricing agent, to report the estimated cash incomings and outgoings of one or more share classes of an investment fund on one or more trade dates.
/// The cash movements may result from, for example, redemption, subscription, switch transactions or reinvestment of dividends.
/// Usage
/// The FundEstimatedCashForecastReport is used to report estimated cash movements, that is, it is sent prior to the cut-off time and/or the price valuation of the fund.
/// The message contains incoming and outgoing cash flows that are estimated, that is, the price has not been applied. If the price is definitive, then the FundConfirmedCashForecastReport message must be used.
/// The message structure allows for the following uses:
/// -	to provide cash in and cash out amounts for a fund/sub fund (FundOrSubFundDetails sequence is used),
/// -	to provide cash in and cash out amounts for a fund/sub fund and one or more share classes (a FundOrSubFundDetails sequence and one or more EstimatedFundCashForecastDetails sequences are used),
/// -	to provide cash in and cash out amounts for one or more share classes (one or more EstimatedFundCashForecastDetails sequences are used).
/// -	to provide cash in and cash out amounts for more than one fund/sub fund, and more than one share classes (two or more FundOrSubFundDetails sequences and two or more EstimatedFundCashForecastDetails sequences and used); however, it should be noted that, in this usage, there is no way to determine which share class belongs to which fund/sub fund from the message content itself, which may not be desirable and the use of this kind of combination should be bilaterally agreed.
/// This message allows the report provider to report estimated cash movements in or out of a fund, but does not allow the Sender to categorise these movements, for example by country, or to give details of the underlying orders, commission or charges. If the report provider wishes to give detailed information related to estimated cash movements, then the FundDetailedEstimatedCashForecastReport message must be used.
