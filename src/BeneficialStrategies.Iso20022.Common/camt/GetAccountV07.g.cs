/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the camt.003.001.07 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// The GetAccount message is sent by a member to the transaction administrator.
/// It is used to request information on the details of one or more accounts held at the transaction administrator, including information on the balances.
/// Usage
/// At any time during the operating hours of the system, the member can query the transaction administrator to get information about the account(s) that the transaction administrator maintains for the member.
/// For example, this may be necessary in order to perform the appropriate liquidity management and the funds transfers between accounts.
/// The member can request information about accounts through a series of criteria, corresponding to the known information stored at the transaction administrator.
/// The query can concern one or more specific accounts, accounts of a particular identification, or a particular type. The purpose of the query may be to obtain one or more types of balance.
/// The member can request information based on the following elements:
/// - account identification
/// - account type (this element can be used to refine the query when the account identification represents, for example, a group of accounts)
/// - balance type (if not present, all balances are requested)
/// - type of counterparty: bilateral or multilateral (note that, by default, a balance is multilateral unless a particular counterparty is specified)
/// - identification of the counterparty when a bilateral balance is requested
/// - balance value date (if not present in the GetAccount message, the ReturnAccount message will contain the latest available balance)
/// This message will be answered by a ReturnAccount message.
/// Additional information on the generic design of the Get/Return messages can be found in the section How to Use the Cash Management Messages.
