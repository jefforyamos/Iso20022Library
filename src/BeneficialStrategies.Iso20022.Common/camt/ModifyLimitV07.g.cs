For example, the reason may be to unlock the payments queue regarding a particular member, or following a risk management decision issued after an exceptional event has occurred.|The member will submit a message requesting modifications in one or more of the following criteria: |- type of limit (current/default)|- identification of the system|- identification of the counterparty|- value of the limit(s) (default and/or current limit(s))|- point in time when the limit becomes effective|Based on the criteria received within the ModifyLimit message, the transaction administrator will execute or reject the requested modification.
