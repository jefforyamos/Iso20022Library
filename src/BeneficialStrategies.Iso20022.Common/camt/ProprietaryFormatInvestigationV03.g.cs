/// It is used as an envelope for a non standard message and provides means to manage an exception or investigation which falls outside the scope or capability of any other formatted message.
/// The ProprietaryData element must contain a well formed XML document. This means XML special characters such as '<' must be used in a way that is consistent with XML well-formedness criteria.|.
