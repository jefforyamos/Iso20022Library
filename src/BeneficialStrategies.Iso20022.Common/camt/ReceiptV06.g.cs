/// Scope
/// The Receipt message is sent by the transaction administrator to a member of the system. It is sent to acknowledge the receipt of one or multiple messages sent previously.
/// The Receipt message is an application receipt acknowledgement and conveys information about the processing of the original message(s).
/// Usage
/// The Receipt message is used when the exchange of messages takes place in an asynchronous manner.
/// This may happen, for instance, when an action is requested from the transaction administrator (a deletion, modification or cancellation). The transaction administrator will first acknowledge the request (with a Receipt message) and then execute it.
/// The message can contain information based on the following elements: reference of the message(s) it acknowledges, the status code (optional) and further explanation:
/// - reference of the message it acknowledges
/// - potentially, a status code and an explanation.
