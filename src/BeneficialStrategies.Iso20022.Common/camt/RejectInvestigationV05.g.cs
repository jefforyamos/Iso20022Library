/// <summary>
/// Scope
/// The Reject Investigation message is sent by a case assignee to a case creator or case assigner to reject a case given to him.
/// Usage
/// The Reject Investigation message is used to notify the case creator or case assigner the rejection of an assignment by the case assignee in a:
/// - request to cancel payment case
/// - request to modify payment case
/// - unable to apply case
/// - claim non receipt case
/// Rejecting a case assignment occurs when:
/// - the case assignee is unable to trace the original payment instruction
/// - the case assignee is unable, or does not have authority, to process the assigned case (indicate "You have by-passed a party",
/// - the case assignee has received a non expected message, and rejects the message with a wrong message indicator
/// - the case assignee has not yet received the Resolution Of Investigation message and the case has already been reopened
/// - the case assignee has rejects an non-cash related query
/// The Reject Investigation message covers one and only one case at a time. If the case assignee needs to reject several case assignments, then multiple Reject Investigation messages must be sent.
/// The Reject Investigation message must be forwarded by all subsequent case assignee(s) until it reaches the case assigner and must not be used in place of a Resolution Of Investigation or Case Status Report message.
