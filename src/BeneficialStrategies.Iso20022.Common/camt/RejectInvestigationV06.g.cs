/// Scope
/// The RejectInvestigation message is sent by a case assignee to a case creator or case assigner to reject a case given to him.
/// Usage
/// The RejectInvestigation message is used to notify the case creator or case assigner the rejection of an assignment by the case assignee in a:
/// - request to cancel payment case;
/// - request to modify payment case;
/// - unable to apply case;
/// - claim non receipt case.
/// Rejecting a case assignment occurs when:
/// - the case assignee is unable to trace the original payment instruction;
/// - the case assignee is unable, or does not have authority, to process the assigned case (indicate "You have by-passed a party";
/// - the case assignee has received a non expected message, and rejects the message with a wrong message indicator;
/// - the case assignee has not yet received the ResolutionOfInvestigation message and the case has already been reopened;
/// - the case assignee has rejects an non-cash related query.
/// The RejectInvestigation message covers one and only one case at a time. If the case assignee needs to reject several case assignments, then multiple RejectInvestigation messages must be sent.
/// The RejectInvestigation message must be forwarded by all subsequent case assignee(s) until it reaches the case assigner and must not be used in place of a ResolutionOfInvestigation or CaseStatusReport message.
