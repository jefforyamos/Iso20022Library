/// Scope
/// The Request For Duplicate message is sent by the case assignee to the case creator or case assigner.
/// This message is used to request a copy of the original payment instruction considered in the case.
/// Usage
/// The Request For Duplicate message:
/// - must be answered with a Duplicate message
/// - must be used when a case assignee requests a copy of the original payment instruction. This occurs, for example, when the case assignee cannot trace the payment instruction based on the elements mentioned in the case assignment message
/// - covers one and only one instruction at a time. If several payment instruction copies are needed by the case assignee, then multiple Request For Duplicate messages must be sent
/// - must be used exclusively between the case assignee and its case creator/case assigner.
