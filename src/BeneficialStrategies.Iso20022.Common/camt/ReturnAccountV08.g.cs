The purpose of the query may be to obtain one or more types of balance.|The transaction administrator may also send a ReturnAccount message with pre-defined information, at times previously agreed with the member, or to warn the member about a particular problem that may have arisen and which needs attention.|The message from the transaction administrator can contain information based on the following elements: |- account identification|- account name|- account type (this is used when the account identification represents, for example, a group of accounts)|- currency of the account (this is used for example when the account identification represents a group of account in various currencies, or when it is a multi-currency account with one single identifier)|- type of balance (if not present in the GetAccount message, all balances will be reported)|- bilateral or multilateral limits|- related counterparty (when the limit or balance is bilateral)|- balance value date (if not present in the GetAccount message, the ReturnAccount message will contain the latest available balance)|- number of payments to the additional account information on the generic design of the Get/Return messages can be found in the section How to Use the Cash Management Messages.
