/// <summary>
/// Scope
/// The ReturnLimit message is sent by the transaction administrator to a member of the system.
/// It is used to provide information on the details of one or more limits set by the member (or on behalf of the member) and managed by the transaction administrator.
/// The ReturnLimit message can be sent as a response to a related GetLimit message (pull mode) or initiated by the transaction administrator (push mode). The push of information can take place either at prearranged times or as a warning or alarm when a problem has occurred.
/// Usage
/// At any time during the operating hours of the system, the member can query the transaction administrator to get information about the limit(s) that the transaction administrator manages for the member.
/// The transaction administrator may also send a ReturnLimit message with pre-defined information at times previously agreed with the member or to warn the member about a particular problem that may have arisen and which needs attention.
/// The message from the transaction administrator can contain information on the following elements:
/// - type of risk and/or liquidity limit
/// - value of the limit(s) (default and/or current limit(s) for risk and/or liquidity management)
/// - identification of the system
/// - status of the limit(s) (default and/or current limit(s) for risk and/or liquidity management)
/// - point in time when the limit becomes effective
/// - identification of the counterparty
/// Additional information on the generic design of the Get/Return messages can be found in the section How to Use the Cash Management Messages.
