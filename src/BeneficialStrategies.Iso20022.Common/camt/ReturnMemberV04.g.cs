/// Scope
/// The ReturnMember message is sent by the transaction administrator to a member of the system.
/// It is used to provide information on static data maintained by the transaction administrator and related to the participants in the system and their membership status vis-a-vis this system.
/// The ReturnMember message can be sent as a response to a related GetMember message (pull mode) or initiated by the transaction administrator (push mode). The push of information can take place either at prearranged times or as a warning or alarm when a problem has occurred.
/// Usage
/// The transaction administrator is in charge of providing the members with business information. The term business information covers all information related to the management of the system, that is, not related to the transactions entered into in the system. The type of business information available can vary depending on the system. Among other things, it can refer to information about the membership of the system.
/// The member can request information about the members of the system through a series of criteria, corresponding to the known information stored within the transaction administrator. Based on the criteria received within the request, the transaction administrator will select items that will match with the request and report them to the requestor.
/// The transaction administrator may also send a Return Member message with pre-defined information at times previously agreed with the member or to warn the member about a particular problem that may have arisen and which needs the member(s) attention.
/// The message from the transaction administrator can contain information based on the following elements:
/// - identification of the member within the system
/// - membership status
/// - type of member
/// - contact details for the member: name, address
/// - identification of the member's account
/// - identification of contact persons for the member, their role and details.
