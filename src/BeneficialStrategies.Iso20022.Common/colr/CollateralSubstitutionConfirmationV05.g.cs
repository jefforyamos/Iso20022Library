/// This record is an implementation of the colr.012.001.05 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// The CollateralSubstitutionConfirmation message is sent by:
/// - the collateral taker or its collateral manager to the collateral giver or its collateral manager, or
/// - the collateral giver or its collateral manager to the collateral taker or its collateral manager.
/// This message confirms the collateral delivery. The collateral taker will only release the return of collateral when the new piece of collateral is received. The collateral giver sends the collateral taker the notification that the collateral substitution (that is new piece(s) of collateral) have been released. In the event that multiple pieces of collateral are being delivered in place of the collateral due to be returned by the giver, this message should only be generated once all collateral pieces have been agreed between both parties. Then the taker confirms that the collateral substitution (that is all pieces have been received) and acknowledges return of collateral.
