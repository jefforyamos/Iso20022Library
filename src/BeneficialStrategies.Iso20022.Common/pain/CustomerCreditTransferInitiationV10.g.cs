/// <summary>
/// Scope
/// The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message is sent by the initiating party to the forwarding agent or debtor agent. It is used to request movement of funds from the debtor account to a creditor.
/// Usage
/// The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message can contain one or more customer credit transfer instructions.
/// The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message is used to exchange:
/// - One or more instances of a credit transfer initiation;
/// - Payment transactions that result in book transfers at the debtor agent or payments to another financial institution;
/// - Payment transactions that result in an electronic cash transfer to the creditor account or in the emission of a cheque.
/// The message can be used in a direct or a relay scenario:
/// - In a direct scenario, the message is sent directly to the debtor agent. The debtor agent is the account servicer of the debtor.
/// - In a relay scenario, the message is sent to a forwarding agent. The forwarding agent acts as a concentrating financial institution. It will forward the CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message to the debtor agent.
/// The message can also be used by an initiating party that has authority to send the message on behalf of the debtor. This caters for example for the scenario of a payments factory initiating all payments on behalf of a large corporate.
/// The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message can be used in domestic and cross-border scenarios.
/// The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message must not be used by the debtor agent to execute the credit transfer instruction(s). The FIToFICustomerCreditTransfer message must be used instead.
