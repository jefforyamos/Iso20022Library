/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the pain.002.001.08 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// The CustomerPaymentStatusReport message is sent by an instructed agent to the previous party in the payment chain. It is used to inform this party about the positive or negative status of an instruction (either single or file). It is also used to report on a pending instruction.
/// Usage
/// The CustomerPaymentStatusReport message is exchanged between an agent and a non-financial institution customer to provide status information on instructions previously sent. Its usage will always be governed by a bilateral agreement between the agent and the non-financial institution customer.
/// The CustomerPaymentStatusReport message can be used to provide information about the status (e.g. rejection, acceptance) of the initiation of a credit transfer, a direct debit, as well as on the initiation of other customer instructions.
/// The CustomerPaymentStatusReport message refers to the original instruction(s) by means of references only or by means of references and a set of elements from the original instruction.
/// The CustomerPaymentStatusReport message can be used in domestic and cross-border scenarios.
/// The CustomerPaymentStatusReport may also be sent to the receiver of the payment in a real time payment scenario, as both sides of the transactions must be informed of the status of the transaction (e.g. either the beneficiary is credited, or the transaction is rejected).
