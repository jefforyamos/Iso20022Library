/// <summary>
/// Scope
/// The FundReferenceDataReport message is sent by a report provider, for example, a fund promoter, fund management company, transfer agent, or market data provider to the report recipient, for example, a professional investor, investment fund distributor, market data provider, regulator or other interested party, to provide the key reference data for financial instruments to facilitate trading. The message may also include reporting data concerning product governance, such as target market data, and a breakdown of the costs and fees.
/// Usage
/// A FundReferenceDataReport message should be prepared for each class of unit/share (for which an individual ISIN should have been allocated), in respect of its "home" market. Each time the fund data changes, the ‘product provider’ must provide the data to a product user, for example, the distributors, by sending a new funds reference data report. A single message may contain more than one report. When the FundReferenceDataReport message is sent to provide updated reference data, the message overwrites the previously sent data.
/// The FundReferenceDataReport message may be used in various models or environments:
/// -	in a standalone environment, for example, initiated by the Report Provider (fund promoter, fund manager and / or reference data vendors) sent on a regular frequency, or when changes are needed.
/// -	in a request / response environment, with the InvestmentFundReportRequest, for example, initiated by report users (data vendors, professional investors, regulators or investment fund distributors) in enabling the user to control the flow and updates of information.
/// -	in a reference data vendor environment, for example, market infrastructure and reference data providers may collate and store all fund reference data information centrally for access via database or regular distribution information. A reference data vendor may assume the role of both report provider and report user.
/// The FundReferenceDataReport message may be used to provide data concerning product governance, such as target market data, and a breakdown of the costs and fees in the context of MiFID II, with respect to the European MiFID Template (EMT) version 3.
