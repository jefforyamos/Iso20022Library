/// SCOPE
/// A report provider, for example, a transfer agent, fund accountant or market data provider, sends the PriceReportCancellation message to the report recipient, for example, a fund management company, transfer agent, market data provider, regulator or any other interested party to cancel previously sent prices.|
/// USAGE
/// The PriceReportCancellation message is used to either: |- cancel an entire PriceReport that was previously sent (by quoting the business reference of the original price report in the PriceReportIdentification element), or,|- cancel one or more individual prices from a previously sent price report (by using the PriceDetailsToBeCancelled sequence).|Technically, it is possible to cancel all the prices individually by using the PriceDetailsToBeCancelled sequence, but this is not recommended.|The cancellation should not contain the cancellation of prices for more than one NAV date.
