/// This record is an implementation of the reda.013.001.01 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// SCOPE
/// An instructing party sends a SecurityDeletionRequest message to an executing/servicing party to advice the complete removal of a financial instrument entry from their system.
/// 
/// The instructing party - executing/servicing party relationship may be:
/// - Central Securities Depositories (CSD) who would like to publish security static data, or 
/// - a Corporate, or
/// - a Bank, or
/// - a Market Infrastructure, or 
/// - a Market Data Provider.
/// 
/// USAGE
/// The request is sent when the instructing party identified that a security is wrongly created in the securities coverage of the executing/servicing party. The instructing party needs this security to be removed from the executing /servicing party database. 
/// This message can be used when a security identification code was issued too quickly or if a security identification code needs to be reused (for example, in case of money market instrument). The result of this message is a complete removal of the security identification from the executing/servicing party's database.
