/// <summary>
/// Scope
/// The MarginReport message is sent by the central counterparty (CCP) to a clearing member to report on:
/// - the exposure resulting from the trade positions
/// - the value of the collateral held by the CCP (market value of this collateral) and
/// - the resulting difference representing the risk encountered by the CCP.
/// The message definition is intended for use with the ISO20022 Business Application Header.
/// Usage
/// There are four possibilities to report the above information. Indeed, the margin report may be structured as follows:
/// - per clearing member: the report will only show the information for the clearing member, or
/// - per clearing member and per financial instrument: the report will show the information for the clearing member, structured by security identification, or
/// - per clearing member and per non clearing member: the report will show the information for the clearing member (that is for global clearing member only) structured by non clearing member(s), or
/// - per clearing member and per non clearing member and per security identification: the report will show the information for the clearing member (global clearing member only) structured by non clearing member(s) and by security identification.
