/// This message is used to request the cancellation of a pending deactivation instruction. The cancellation must apply to exactly the same level as the original instruction, ie to the entire CA event or to an option as per the original instruction.
/// This message must be sent before the deactivation execution date.
/// In case a corporate action or option is already deactivated, this message can not be used to reactivate the corporate action entire event or option; the notification advice message must be used to reactivate a corporate action or option.
