/// If this message is used for a new election advice, the function of the message must be 'new election'.
/// If this message is used for an amended election advice, the function of the message must be 'option change' and the identification of the previously sent election advice must be present.
/// This message can include the cash movements and/or securities movements in the case of an election with underlying resource movements. Additionally, this message can include delivery, certification and beneficial owner details.
