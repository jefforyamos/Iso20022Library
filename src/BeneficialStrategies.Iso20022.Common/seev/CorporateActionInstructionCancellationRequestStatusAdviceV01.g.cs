/// Scope
/// An account servicer sends the CorporateActionInstructionCancellationRequestStatusAdvice message to an account owner or its designated agent to report status of a previously received CorporateActionInstructionCancellationRequest message sent by the account owner.
/// This will include the acknowledgement/rejection of a request to cancel an outstanding instruction.
/// Usage
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent (the sub-function of the message is Duplicate),
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy),
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy Duplicate).|ISO 15022 - 20022 COEXISTENCE|This ISO 20022 message is reversed engineered from ISO 15022. Both standards will coexist for a certain number of years. Until this coexistence period ends, the usage of certain data types is restricted to ensure interoperability between ISO 15022 and 20022 users.
