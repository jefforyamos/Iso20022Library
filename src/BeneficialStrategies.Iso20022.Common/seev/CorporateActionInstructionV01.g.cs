/// This record is an implementation of the seev.033.001.01 ISO standard message type.

/// Scope
/// An account owner sends the CorporateActionInstruction message to an account servicer to instruct election on a corporate action event.
/// This message is used to provide the custodian with instructions on how the account owner wishes to proceed with a corporate action event. Instructions include investment decisions regarding the exercise of rights issues, the election of stock or cash when the option is available, and decisions on the conversion or tendering of securities.
/// Usage
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent (the sub-function of the message is Duplicate),
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy),
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy Duplicate).|ISO 15022 - 20022 COEXISTENCE|This ISO 20022 message is reversed engineered from ISO 15022. Both standards will coexist for a certain number of years. Until this coexistence period ends, the usage of certain data types is restricted to ensure interoperability between ISO 15022 and 20022 users.
