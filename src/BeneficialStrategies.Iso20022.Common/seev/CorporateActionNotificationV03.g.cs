/// Scope
/// An account servicer sends the CorporateActionNotification message to an account owner or its designated agent to notify details of a corporate action event and optionally account information, eligible balance and entitlements. It may also include possible elections or choices available to the account owner.
/// The account servicer can initially send the CorporateActionNotification message as a preliminary advice, subsequently replaced by another CorporateActionNotification message with complete or confirmed information.
/// It may also be sent to an account owner or its designated agent, to remind of event details and/or of missing or incomplete instructions for a corporate action event.
/// Usage
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent (the sub-function of the message is Duplicate),
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy),
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy Duplicate),
/// using the relevant elements in the business application header (BAH).|ISO 15022 - 20022 COEXISTENCE|This ISO 20022 message is reversed engineered from ISO 15022. Both standards will coexist for a certain number of years. Until this coexistence period ends, the usage of certain data types is restricted to ensure interoperability between ISO 15022 and 20022 users.
