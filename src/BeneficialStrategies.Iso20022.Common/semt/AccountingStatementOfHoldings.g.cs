/// Scope
/// The AccountingStatementOfHoldings message is sent by an account servicer to the account owner or the account owner's designated agent. The account servicer may be a local agent acting on behalf of its global custodian customer, a custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a broker/dealer, a fund administrator or fund intermediary, trustee or registrar, etc.
/// This message provides, at a specified moment in time, valuations of the portfolio together with details of each financial instrument holding.
/// The information in the message can be audited or un-audited.
/// Usage
/// The AccountingStatementOfHoldings message can be sent:
/// - At a frequency agreed bi-laterally between the Sender and the Receiver
/// - As a response to a request for statement sent by the account owner. The request for statement message will be developed at a later stage.
/// This message can only be used to list the holdings of a single (master) account. However, it is possible to break down these holdings into one or several sub-accounts. Therefore, the message can be used to either specify holdings at
/// - the main account level, or
/// - the sub-account level.
/// This message can be used to report where the securities are safe-kept, physically or notionally. If a security is held in more than one safekeeping place, this can also be indicated.
/// The AccountingStatementOfHoldings message must not be used to reconcile the books of the account owner and the account servicer. The CustodyStatementOfHoldings message is used for reconciliation purposes.
/// The AccountingStatementOfHoldings message must not be used for trading purposes.
/// Since a SWIFT message as sent is restricted to the maximum input message length, several messages may be needed to accommodate all the information.
