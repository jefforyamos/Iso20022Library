/// <summary>
/// Scope
/// An account servicer, for example, a transfer agent sends the AccountStatementOfHoldings message to the account owner, for example, a fund manager or an account owner's designated agent to provide detailed holdings of the portfolio at a specified moment in time.
/// The message provides, at a moment in time, valuations of the portfolio together with details of each financial instrument holding.
/// The message can be sent either audited or un-audited and may be provided on a trade date or settlement date basis.
/// Usage
/// The AccountingStatementOfHoldings message is used to provide valuation detail for each financial instrument held in a portfolio. The message should be sent at a frequency agreed bi-laterally between the account servicer and the account owner.
/// This message can only be used to list the holdings of a single (master) account. However, it is possible to break down these holdings into one or several sub-accounts. Therefore, the message can be used to either specify holdings at
/// - the main account level, or,
/// - the sub-account level.
/// This message can be used to report where the financial instruments are safe-kept, physically or notionally. If a security is held in more than one safekeeping place, this can also be indicated.
/// The AccountingStatementOfHoldings message should not be used for trading purposes.
