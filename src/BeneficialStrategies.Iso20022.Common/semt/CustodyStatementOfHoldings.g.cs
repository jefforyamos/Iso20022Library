/// <summary>
/// Scope
/// The CustodyStatementOfHoldings message is sent by an account servicer to the account owner or the account owner's designated agent. The account servicer may be a local agent acting on behalf of its global custodian customer, a custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a broker/dealer, a fund administrator or fund intermediary, trustee or registrar, etc.
/// This message reports, at a specified moment in time, the quantity and identification of financial instruments that an account servicer holds for the account owner.
/// This message is used to reconcile the books of the account owner and the account servicer for the specified account or sub-account.
/// This message can also report availability and/or the location of security holdings to facilitate trading and minimise settlement issues. The reporting is per financial instrument, ie, when a financial instrument is held at multiple places of safekeeping, the total holding for all locations can be provided.
/// Usage
/// The CustodyStatementOfHoldings message can be sent:
/// - At a frequency agreed bi-laterally between the Sender and the Receiver
/// - As a response to a request for statement sent by the account owner.
/// This message can reflect all outstanding holding information or may only contain changes since the previously sent statement.
/// The CustodyStatementOfHoldings message can only be used to list the holdings of a single (master) account. However, it is possible to break down these holdings into one or several sub-accounts. Therefore, this message can be used to either specify holdings at
/// - the main account level, or
/// - the sub-account level.
/// This message can be also be used to report where the securities are safe-kept, physically or notionally. If a security is held in more than one safekeeping place, this can also be indicated.
/// This message must not be used to report audited positions. Audited positions are reported using the AccountingStatementOfHoldings message.
/// Since a SWIFT message as sent is restricted to the maximum input message length, several messages may be needed to accommodate all the information.
