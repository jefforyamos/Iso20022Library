/// <summary>
/// Scope
/// An account servicer sends a SecuritiesBalanceAccountingReport to an account owner to provide, at a moment in time, valuations of the portfolio together with details of each financial instrument holding.
/// The account servicer/owner relationship may be:
/// - an accounting agent acting on behalf of an account owner, or
/// - a transfer agent acting on behalf of a fund manager or an account owner's designated agent.
/// Usage
/// The message should be sent at a frequency agreed bi-laterally between the account servicer and the account owner.
/// The message can be sent either audited or un-audited and may be provided on a trade date, contractual or settlement date basis.
/// This message can only be used to list the holdings of a single (master) account. However, it is possible to break down these holdings into one or several sub-accounts. Therefore, the message can be used to either specify holdings at
/// - the main account level, or,
/// - the sub-account level.
/// This message can be used to report where the financial instruments are safe-kept, physically or notionally. If a security is held in more than one safekeeping place, this can also be indicated.
/// The SecuritiesBalanceAccountingReport message should not be used for trading purposes.
/// There may be one or more intermediary parties, for example, an intermediary or a concentrator between the account owner and account servicer.
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent,
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information,
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information.
