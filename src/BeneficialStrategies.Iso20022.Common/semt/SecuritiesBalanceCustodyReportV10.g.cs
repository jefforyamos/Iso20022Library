/// Scope
/// An account servicer sends a SecuritiesBalanceCustodyReport to an account owner to provide, at a moment in time, the quantity and identification of the financial instruments that the account servicer holds for the account owner.
/// The account servicer/owner relationship may be:
/// - a central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure acting on behalf of their participants, or
/// - an agent (sub-custodian) acting on behalf of their global custodian customer, or 
/// - a custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a broker/dealer, or
/// - a transfer agent acting on behalf of a fund manager or an account owner's designated agent.
/// Usage
/// The message can also include availability and the location of holdings to facilitate trading and minimise settlement issues. The message reports all information per financial instrument, that is, when a financial instrument is held at multiple places of safekeeping, the total holdings for all locations can be provided. 
/// The message should be sent at a frequency agreed bi-laterally between the account servicer and the account owner. The message may be provided on a trade date, contractual or settlement date basis. 
/// There may be one or more intermediary parties, for example, an intermediary or a concentrator between the account owner and account servicer.
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent,
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information,
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.
