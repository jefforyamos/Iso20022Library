/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the semt.020.001.02 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// An account servicer sends a SecuritiesMessageCancellationAdvice to an account owner to inform of the cancellation of a securities message previously sent by an account servicer.
/// The account servicer/owner relationship may be:
/// - a central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure acting on behalf of their participants
/// - an agent (sub-custodian) acting on behalf of their global custodian customer, or
/// - a custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a broker/dealer.
/// Usage
/// The previously sent message may be:
/// - a securities settlement transaction confirmation
/// - a report (transactions, pending transactions, allegements, accounting and custody securities balance)
/// - an allegement notification (when sent by mistake or because the counterparty cancelled its instruction)
/// - a portfolio transfer notification
/// - an intra-position movement confirmation
/// - a transaction generation notification
/// The previously sent message cannot be a status advice message (any). If a status advice should not have been sent, a new status advice with the correct status should be sent, not a cancellation advice.
/// The message may also be used to:|- re-send a message previously sent,|- provide a third party with a copy of a message for information,|- re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information.|using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.|ISO 15022 - 20022 Coexistence|This ISO 20022 message is reversed engineered from ISO 15022.
