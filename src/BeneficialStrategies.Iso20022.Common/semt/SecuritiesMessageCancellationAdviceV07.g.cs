/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the semt.020.001.07 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// An account servicer sends a SecuritiesMessageCancellationAdvice to an account owner to inform of the cancellation of a securities message previously sent by an account servicer. 
/// The account servicer/owner relationship may be:
/// - a central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure acting on behalf of their participants
/// - an agent (sub-custodian) acting on behalf of their global custodian customer, or 
/// - a custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a broker/dealer.
/// 
/// Usage
/// The previously sent message may be:
/// - a securities settlement transaction confirmation
/// - a report (transactions, pending transactions, allegements, accounting and custody securities balance)
/// - a allegement notification (when sent by mistake or because the counterparty cancelled its instruction)
/// - a portfolio transfer notification 
/// - an intra-position movement confirmation
/// - a transaction generation notification
/// 
/// The previously sent message cannot be a status advice message (any). If a status advice should not have been sent, a new status advice with the correct status should be sent, not a cancellation advice.
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent,
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information,
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information
/// using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.
