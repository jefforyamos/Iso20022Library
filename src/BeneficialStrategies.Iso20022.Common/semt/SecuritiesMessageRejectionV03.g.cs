/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the semt.001.001.03 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// An account servicer, for example, a registrar, transfer agent or custodian bank, sends the SecuritiesMessageRejection message to the account owner, for example, an investor or its authorised agent, to reject a previously received message on which action cannot be taken.
/// The message may also be sent by an executing party, for example, transfer agent to the instructing party, for example, investment manager or its authorised representative to reject a previously received message on which action cannot be taken.
/// Usage
/// The SecuritiesMessageRejection message is used for the following reasons:
/// - the executing party does not recognise the linked reference, so the executing party cannot process the message
/// - the instructing party should not have sent the message.
/// Reasons that a receiver does not expect a message include no SLA in place between the Sender and the Receiver.
/// The SecuritiesMessageRejection message must not be used to reject an instruction message that cannot be processed for business reasons, for example, if information is missing in an instruction message or because securities are not available for settlement.
