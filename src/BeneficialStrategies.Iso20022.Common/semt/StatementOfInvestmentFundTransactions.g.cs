/// Scope
/// The StatementOfInvestmentFundTransactions is sent by an account servicer to the account owner or the account owner's designated agent. The account servicer may be a fund administrator or fund intermediary, trustee or registrar.
/// This message provides the details of increases and decreases of holdings which occurred during a specified period.
/// This message can also be used for information purposes, eg, tax information.
/// Usage
/// The StatementOfInvestmentFundTransactions message can be sent:
/// - At a frequency agreed bi-laterally between the Sender and the Receiver and/or
/// - As a response to a request for statement sent by the account owner.
/// The StatementOfInvestmentFundTransactions message can only be used to list the transactions of a single (master) account. However, it is possible to break down these transactions into one or several sub-accounts. Therefore, the message can be used to either specify transactions at
/// - the main account level, or
/// - the sub-account level.
/// This message must not be used in place of confirmation messages.
/// Since a SWIFT message as sent is restricted to the maximum input message length, several messages may be needed to accommodate all the information.
