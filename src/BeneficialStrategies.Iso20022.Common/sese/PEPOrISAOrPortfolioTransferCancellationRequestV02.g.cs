/// Scope
/// An instructing party, eg, a (new) plan manager, sends the PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferCancellationRequest message to the executing party, eg, a (old) plan manager, to request the cancellation of a previously sent PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction.
/// Usage
/// The PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of an entire PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction message, ie, all the product transfers that it contained. The cancellation request can be specified either by:
/// - quoting the transfer references of all the product transfers listed in the PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction message, or,
/// - quoting the details of all the product transfers (this includes TransferReference) listed in PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction message.
/// The message identification of the PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to request the cancellation of PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction by just quoting its message identification in PreviousReference.
