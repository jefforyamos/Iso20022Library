/// Scope
/// An instructing party, for example, a (new) plan manager (Transferee), sends the PortfolioTransferCancellationRequest message to the executing party, for example, a (old) plan manager (Transferor), to request the cancellation of a previously sent PortfolioTransferInstruction.
/// Usage
/// The PortfolioTransferCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of an entire PortfolioTransferInstruction message, ie, all the product transfers that it contained. The cancellation request can be specified either by:
/// - quoting the transfer references of all the product transfers listed in the PortfolioTransferInstruction message, or,
/// - quoting the details of all the product transfers (this includes TransferReference) listed in PortfolioTransferInstruction message.
/// The message identification of the PortfolioTransferInstruction may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to request the cancellation of PortfolioTransferInstruction by just quoting its message identification in PreviousReference.
