/// Scope
/// An account servicer sends a PortfolioTransferNotification to another account servicer to exchange transfer settlement details information during a retail or institutional client portfolio transfer.
/// The account servicers will typically be local agents or global custodians acting on behalf of an investment management institution, a broker/dealer or a retail client.

/// - re-send a message previously sent,
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information,
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information
