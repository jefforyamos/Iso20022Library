/// Scope

/// The account servicers will typically be local agents or global custodians acting on behalf of an investment management institution, a broker/dealer or a retail client.
/// Usage
/// By exchange of transfer settlement details, it is understood the providing, by the delivering account servicer to the receiving account servicer, of the settlement details (trade date, settlement date, delivering settlement chain, quantities, etc.) of the individual transfers that will take place during a full or partial portfolio transfer. This delivering account servicer message may also include, for validation, the receiving settlement chain as provided by the client. In case the receiving settlement chain is not available to the delivering account servicer, the receiving account servicer may in return provide to the delivering account servicer the receiving settlement chain using the same message.
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent (the sub-function of the message is Duplicate),
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy),
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy Duplicate).|ISO 15022 - 20022 Coexistence|This ISO 20022 message is reversed engineered from ISO 15022.
