/// - all the details of the transfer confirmation (this includes TransferReference and TransferConfirmationIdentification) are quoted but this is not recommended.
/// The message identification of the TransferOutConfirmation message in which the transfer out confirmation was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. The message identification of the TransferOutInstruction message in which the transfer out instruction was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference.
