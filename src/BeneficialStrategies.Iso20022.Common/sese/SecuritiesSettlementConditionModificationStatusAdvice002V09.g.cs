/// Scope
/// An account servicer sends a SecuritiesSettlementConditionsModificationStatusAdvice to an account owner to advise the status of a modification request previously instructed by the account owner.
/// The account servicer/owner relationship may be:
/// - a central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure acting on behalf of their participants
/// - an agent (sub-custodian) acting on behalf of their global custodian customer, or
/// - a custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a broker/dealer.
/// Usage
/// A SecuritiesSettlementConditionsModificationRequest may contain requests on multiple transactions. However, one SecuritiesSettlementConditionsModificationStatusAdvice must be sent per transaction modified unless the SecuritiesSettlementConditionsModificationRequest is rejected as a whole.
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent,
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information,
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.
