However, one SecuritiesSettlementConditionsModificationStatusAdvice must be sent per transaction modified unless the SecuritiesSettlementConditionsModificationRequest is rejected as a whole.|The message may also be used to:|- re-send a message previously sent,|- provide a third party with a copy of a message for information,|- re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information|using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.||ISO 15022 - 20022 Coexistence|This ISO 20022 message is reversed engineered from ISO 15022. Both standards will coexist for a certain number of years. Until this coexistence period ends, the usage of certain data types is restricted to ensure interoperability between ISO 15022 and 20022 users.
