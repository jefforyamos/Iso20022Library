/// The account owner/servicer relationship may be:
/// - a central securities depository participant which has an account with a central securities depository.
/// It could also be, if agreed in a service level agreement:
/// - a global custodian which has an account with its local agent (sub-custodian), or
/// - an investment management institution which manage a fund account opened at a custodian, or
/// - a broker which has an account with a custodian, or
/// - a central securities depository which has an account with a custodian, another central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure.
