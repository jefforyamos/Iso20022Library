/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the sese.030.001.05 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// An account owner sends a SecuritiesSettlementConditionsModificationRequest to an account servicer to request the modification of a processing indicator or another non-matching information.
/// 
/// The account owner/servicer relationship may be:
/// - a central securities depository participant which has an account with a central securities depository.
/// It could also be, if agreed in a service level agreement:
/// - a global custodian which has an account with its local agent (sub-custodian), or
/// - an investment management institution which manage a fund account opened at a custodian, or
/// - a broker which has an account with a custodian, or
/// - a central securities depository which has an account with a custodian, another central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure.
/// 
/// Usage
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent,
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information,
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information
/// using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.
/// 
/// In markets where this applies (eg, securities market infrastructures with no pre-settlement matching process), it is used by a party to approve, cancel or reject a transaction instructed by the counterparty.
/// 
/// This message cannot be used to request the modification of trade or event details.
/// The use of AdditionalInformation and its fields must be pre-agreed between account servicer and account owner. The fields in that sequence cannot be used to amend a trade or event detail unless authorised by country market practice.
///
