/// This record is an implementation of the sese.040.001.02 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// An account owner sends a SecuritiesSettlementTransactionCounterpartyResponse to advise the account servicer that:
/// - the allegement received is either rejected (that is counterparty&apos;s transaction is unknown) or accepted (i.e. either the allegement was passed to the client or the transaction is know with or without mismatches)
/// - the modification or cancellation request sent by the counterparty for a matched transaction is affirmed or not. The account servicer will therefore proceed or not with the counterparty&apos;s request to modify or cancel the transaction.
/// The account servicer may be a central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure acting on behalf of their participants
/// The account owner may be:
/// - a central securities depository participant which has an account with a central securities depository or a market infrastructure
/// - an agent (sub-custodian) acting on behalf of their global custodian customer, or
/// - a custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a broker/dealer.
/// 
/// Usage
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message sent by the account owner to the account servicer,
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message being sent by the account owner for information,
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message being sent by the account owner for information
/// using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.
