/// Scope
/// An account servicer sends a SecuritiesSettlementTransactionGenerationNotification to an account owner to advise the account owner of a securities settlement transaction that has been generated/created by the account servicer for the account owner. The reason for creation can range from the automatic transformation of pending settlement instructions following a corporate event to the recovery of an account owner transactions' database initiated by its account servicer.
/// The account servicer/owner relationship may be:
/// - a central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure acting on behalf of their participants
/// - an agent (sub-custodian) acting on behalf of their global custodian customer, or
/// - a custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a broker/dealer
/// Usage
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent,
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information,
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.
