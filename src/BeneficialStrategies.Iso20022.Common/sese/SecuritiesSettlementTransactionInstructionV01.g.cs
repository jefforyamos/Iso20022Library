/// Scope
/// An account owner sends a SecuritiesSettlementTransactionInstruction to an account servicer to instruct the receipt or delivery of financial instruments with or without payment, physically or by book-entry.
/// The account owner/servicer relationship may be:
/// - a global custodian which has an account with a local custodian, or
/// - an investment management institution which manages a fund account opened at a custodian, or
/// - a broker which has an account with a custodian, or
/// - a central securities depository participant which has an account with a central securities depository, or
/// - a central securities depository which has an account with a custodian, another central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure, or
/// - a central counterparty or a stock exchange or a trade matching utility which need to instruct the settlement of transactions to a central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure
/// Usage
/// The instruction may be linked to other settlement instructions, for example, for a turnaround or back-to-back, or other transactions, for example, foreign exchange deal, using the linkage functionality.
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent (the sub-function of the message is Duplicate),
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy),
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy Duplicate).|ISO 15022 - 20022 Coexistence|This ISO 20022 message is reversed engineered from ISO 15022.
