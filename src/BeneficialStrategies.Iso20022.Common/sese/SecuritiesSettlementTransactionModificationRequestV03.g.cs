/// This record is an implementation of the sese.038.001.03 ISO standard message type.

/// Scope
/// This message is sent by an account owner to an account servicer. 
/// 
/// The account owner will generally be:
/// - a central securities depository participant which has an account with a central securities depository or a market infrastructure
/// - an investment manager which has an account with a custodian acting as accounting and/or settlement agent.
/// 
/// It is used to request the modification of non core business data (matching or non-matching) information in a pending or settled instruction. It can also be used for the enrichment of an incomplete transaction.
/// 
/// Usage
/// The modification must only contain the data to be modified.
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message sent by the account owner to the account servicer,
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message being sent by the account owner for information,
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message being sent by the account owner for information
/// using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.
