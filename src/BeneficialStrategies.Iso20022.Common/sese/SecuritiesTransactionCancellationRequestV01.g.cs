/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the sese.020.001.01 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// An account owner sends a SecuritiesTransactionCancellationRequest to an account servicer to request the cancellation of a securities transaction.
/// The account owner/servicer relationship may be:
/// - a global custodian which has an account with a local custodian, or
/// - an investment management institution which manage a fund account opened at a custodian, or - a broker which has an account with a custodian, or
/// - a central securities depository participant which has an account with a central securities depository, or
/// - a central securities depository which has an account with a custodian, another central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure, or
/// - a central counterparty or a stock exchange or a trade matching utility which need to instruct to a central securities depository ot another settlement market infrastructure.
/// Usage
/// The transaction may be:
/// - a securities settlement transaction
/// - an intra-position movement
/// - a securities financing transaction
/// The instruction cannot be:
/// - a securities settlement conditions modification (another transaction processing command should be sent to reverse a processing change previously requested).
/// - a securities financing modification
/// The message may also be used to:
/// - re-send a message previously sent (the sub-function of the message is Duplicate),
/// - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy),
/// - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information (the sub-function of the message is Copy Duplicate).|ISO 15022 - 20022 Coexistence|This ISO 20022 message is reversed engineered from ISO 15022.
