/// There are two ways to specify the transfer cancellation request. Either:
/// - the transfer reference of the original transfer is quoted, or,
/// - all the details of the original transfer (this includes TransferReference) are quoted but this is not recommended.
/// The message identification of the TransferInInstruction message in which the transfer was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to request the cancellation of a TransferInInstruction message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference.
