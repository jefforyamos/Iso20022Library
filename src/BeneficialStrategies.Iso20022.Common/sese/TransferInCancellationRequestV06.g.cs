/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the sese.006.001.06 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// An instructing party, for example, a transfer agent, sends the TransferInCancellationRequest message to the executing party, for example, a transfer agent, to request the cancellation of a previously sent TransferInInstruction.
/// Usage
/// The TransferInCancellationRequest message is used to request cancellation of a previously sent TransferInInstruction.
/// There are two ways to specify the transfer cancellation request. Either:
/// - the transfer reference of the original transfer is quoted, or,
/// - all the details of the original transfer (this includes TransferReference) are quoted but this is not recommended.
/// The message identification of the TransferInInstruction message in which the transfer was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to request the cancellation of a TransferInInstruction message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference.
