/// This record is an implementation of the sese.011.001.05 ISO standard message type.

/// The message identification of the transfer instruction message in which the transfer instruction was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference.
/// One of the following statuses can be reported:
/// - an accepted status, or,
/// - an already executed status, or,
/// - a sent to next party status, or,
/// - a matched status, or,
/// - a settled status, or,
/// - a pending settlement status and the reason for the status, or,
