/// <summary>
/// Scope
/// An instructing party, for example, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the TransferOutCancellationRequest message to the executing party, for example, a transfer agent, to request the cancellation of a previously sent TransferOutInstruction.
/// Usage
/// The TransferOutCancellationRequest message is used to request cancellation of a previously sent TransferOutInstruction. There are two ways to specify the transfer cancellation request. Either:
/// - the transfer reference of the original transfer is quoted, or,
/// - all the details of the original transfer (this includes TransferReference) are quoted but this is not recommended.
/// The message identification of the TransferOutInstruction message in which the original transfer was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to request the cancellation of a TransferOutInstruction message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference.
