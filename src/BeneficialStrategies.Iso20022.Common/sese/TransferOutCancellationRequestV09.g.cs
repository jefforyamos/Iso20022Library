/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the sese.002.001.09 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// The TransferOutCancellationRequest message is sent by an instructing party, for example, an investment manager or its authorised representative, to the executing party, for example, a transfer agent, to request the cancellation of a previously sent transfer out instruction.
/// Usage
/// The TransferOutCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of one or more transfer out instructions.
/// There is no amendment, but a cancellation and re-instruct policy.
/// To request the cancellation of one or more transfer out instructions, the transfer reference of the transfer, as specified in the original TransferOutInstruction message, is specified in the transfer reference element.
/// The message identification of the original TransferOutInstruction message may also be quoted in PreviousReference but this is not recommended.
/// The deadline and acceptance of a cancellation request is subject to a service level agreement (SLA). This cancellation message is a cancellation request. There is no automatic acceptance of the cancellation.
/// The rejection or acceptance of a TransferOutCancellationRequest is made using a TransferCancellationStatusReport message.
/// </summary>
