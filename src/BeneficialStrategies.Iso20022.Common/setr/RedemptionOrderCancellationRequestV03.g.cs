/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the setr.005.001.03 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// An instructing party, for example, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the RedemptionOrderCancellationRequest message to the executing party, for example, a transfer agent, to request the cancellation of a previously sent RedemptionOrder instruction.
/// Usage
/// The RedemptionOrderCancellationRequest message is used to either:
/// - request the cancellation of an entire RedemptionOrder message, that is, all the individual orders that it contained, or,
/// - request the cancellation of one or more individual orders.
/// There is no amendment, but a cancellation and re-instruct policy.
/// There are two ways to use the message:
/// (1) When the RedemptionOrderCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of an entire RedemptionOrder message, this can be done by either:
/// - quoting the order references of all the individual orders listed in the RedemptionOrder message, or,
/// - quoting the details of all the individual orders (this includes the OrderReference) listed in RedemptionOrder message, but this is not recommended.
/// The message identification of the RedemptionOrder message may also be quoted in PreviousReference.
/// It is also possible to request the cancellation of an entire RedemptionOrder message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference, but this is not recommended.
/// (2) When the RedemptionOrderCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of one or more individual orders, this can be done by either:
/// - quoting the OrderReference of each individual order listed in the RedemptionOrder message, or,
/// - quoting the details of each individual order (including the OrderReference) listed in RedemptionOrder message, but this is not recommended.
/// The message identification of the RedemptionOrder message in which the individual order was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference.
/// The deadline and acceptance of a cancellation request is subject to a service level agreement (SLA). This cancellation message is a cancellation request. There is no automatic acceptance of the cancellation.
/// The rejection or acceptance of a RedemptionOrderCancellationRequest is made using an OrderCancellationStatusReport message.
