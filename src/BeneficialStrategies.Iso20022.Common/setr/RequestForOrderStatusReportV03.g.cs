/// - one or several individual order instructions, or,
/// - one or several order messages, or
/// - one or several individual order cancellation requests, or,
/// - one or several order cancellation request messages.
/// The response to a RequestForOrderStatusReport message is the OrderInstructionStatusReport message or OrderCancellationStatusReport message.
