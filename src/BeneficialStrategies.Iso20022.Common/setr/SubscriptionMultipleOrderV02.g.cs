/// Scope
/// The SubscriptionMultipleOrder message is sent by an instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, to an executing party, eg, a transfer agent. There may be one or more intermediary parties between the instructing party and the executing party. The intermediary party is, for example, an intermediary or a concentrator.
/// This message is used to instruct the executing party to subscribe to one or more financial instruments, for the same account.
/// Usage
/// The SubscriptionMultipleOrder message is used for multiple orders. It may also be used for single orders, ie, a message containing one order for one financial instrument and related to one investment account. For a single subscription order, the SubscriptionMultipleOrder message, not the SubscriptionBulkOrder message, must be used.
/// If there are subscription orders for the same financial instrument but for different accounts, then the SubscriptionBulkOrder message must be used.
