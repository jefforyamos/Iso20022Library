/// Scope
/// The SubscriptionOrder message is sent by an instructing party, for example, an investment manager or its authorised representative, to the executing party, for example, a transfer agent, to instruct the subscription of one or more financial instruments for one investment fund account.
/// Usage
/// The SubscriptionOrder message is used to instruct single subscription orders, that is, a message containing one order for one financial instrument for one investment account. The SubscriptionOrder message may also be used for multiple orders, that is, a message containing several orders for the same investment account for different financial instruments.
/// For a single subscription order, the SubscriptionOrder message, not the SubscriptionBulkOrder message, must be used.
/// If there are subscription orders for the same financial instrument but for different accounts that are to be communicated in a single message, then the SubscriptionBulkOrder message must be used.
