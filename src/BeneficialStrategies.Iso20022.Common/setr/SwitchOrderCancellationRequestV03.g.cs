/// <summary>
/// This record is an implementation of the setr.014.001.03 ISO standard message type.
/// There are significant differences between different variants of the same message. It is crucial that you select exactly the implementation you intend to send or receive.
/// Scope
/// An instructing party, for example, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the SwitchOrderCancellationRequest message to the executing party, for example, a transfer agent, to request the cancellation of a previously sent SwitchOrder instruction.
/// Usage
/// The SwitchOrderCancellationRequest is used to cancel the entire previously sent SwitchOrder instruction and all the individual legs that it contains. There is no amendment, but a cancellation and re-instruct policy.
/// There are two ways to specify the switch cancellation. Either:
/// - the order reference of the original switch order is quoted, or,
/// - all the details of the original switch order (this includes the OrderReference) are quoted, but this is not recommended.
/// The message identification of the SwitchOrder message may also be quoted in PreviousReference.
/// It is also possible to request the cancellation of a SwitchOrder message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference, but this is not recommended.
/// The deadline and acceptance of a cancellation request is subject to a service level agreement (SLA). This cancellation message is a cancellation request. There is no automatic acceptance of the cancellation request.
/// The rejection or acceptance of a SwitchOrderCancellationRequest is made using an OrderCancellationStatusReport message.
