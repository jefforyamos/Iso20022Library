/// Scope
/// An executing party, for example, a transfer agent, sends the SwitchOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message to the instructing party, for example, an investment manager or its authorised representative to amend a previously sent SwitchOrderConfirmation message.
/// Usage
/// The SwitchOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel a previously sent SwitchOrderConfirmation.
/// The amendment indicator element is used to specify whether the switch order confirmation cancellation is to be followed by a switch order confirmation amendment.
/// There are two ways to specify the switch order confirmation cancellation. Either:
/// - the business references, for example, OrderReference, DealReference, of the switch order confirmation are quoted, or,
/// - all the details of the switch order confirmation (this includes the OrderReference and DealReference) are quoted, but this is not recommended.
/// The message identification of the SwitchOrderConfirmation message may also be quoted in PreviousReference.
/// It is also possible to instruct the cancellation of the confirmation message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference, but this is not recommended.
