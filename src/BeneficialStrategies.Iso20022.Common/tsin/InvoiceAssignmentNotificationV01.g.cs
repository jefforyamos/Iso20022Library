/// This message is sent from a factoring service provider or a factoring client to a trade partner to inform about assignments of financing items and, optionally, to an interested party.

/// The message indicates whether the notified party is required to acknowledge the notified assignment and to which party an acknowledgement has to be sent.
/// This message can also be used outside a factoring context directly between a payer and a payee for example as a reminder about a payment obligation or to make an adjustment.
/// If applicable, the message may reference corresponding items of an InvoiceFinancingRequest or InvoiceFinancingStatus or other related messages and may contain referenced data.
