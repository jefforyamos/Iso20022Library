/// The message InvoiceAssignmentStatus is sent by a factoring service provider to a factoring client and, optionally, to an interested party as a response to assignments requests.
/// The factoring service provider returns a copy of items of corresponding requests together with an information about the status of treatment, for example acceptance, rejection or treatment not yet finished. A rejection can be the result of bad message syntax, but also for other motives such as risk, compliance or covenants.
/// For each reported financial item, the factoring service provider includes a reference to the corresponding item of the InvoiceFinancingRequest message and may include the referenced item as well as data from other related and referenced messages.
/// The message contains information about other parties to be notified and whether these parties are required to acknowledge the assignment.
/// The message can carry digital signatures if required by context.
