/// Scope
/// The BaselineReSubmission message is sent by either the counterparty or the initiator of a transaction (baseline) to the matching application.
/// This message is used by the counterparty to respond on the registration of a push-through transaction in the matching application or by the initiator or counterparty to re-send earlier mis-matched baseline information.
/// Usage
/// The BaselineReSubmission message can be sent by the counterparty of a transaction to the matching application in response to a FullPushThroughReport message received from the matching application conveying the details of an InitialBaselineSubmission message. The objective of the BaselineReSubmission message sent in the outlined scenario is to achieve a successful match of two baseline initiation messages in order to establish a transaction in the matching application.
/// or

The objective of the BaselineReSubmission message sent in the outlined scenario is to correct an InitialBaselineSubmission or BaselineReSubmission message submitted earlier in order to achieve the establishment of a transaction in the matching application.
