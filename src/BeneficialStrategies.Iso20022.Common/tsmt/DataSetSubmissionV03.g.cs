/// The DataSetSubmission message can be sent by either party with the instruction pre-match. In the outlined scenario, the matching application will compare the data set(s) conveyed by the DataSetSubmission message with the established baseline and report the matching result to the requester of the data set pre-match by sending a DataSetMatchReport message.
